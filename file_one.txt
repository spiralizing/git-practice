git fetch vs git pull

git fetch download changes on the remote repository but won't make them in the local directory.
git fetch + merge is similar to do a pull

git fetch <branch name>

git switch and git checkout

checkout command tells you what is going on in a particular branch.

git checkout <branch name>

Branches are pointers to commits, when we create a branch all git needs to do is create a new pointer

HEAD:
it helps us to know where are we located.

git branch <name branch> #creates a new branch
git branch #report branches
git switch #switches branches

#this line is added only on the main branch
